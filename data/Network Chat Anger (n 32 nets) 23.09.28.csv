Same same Ya the question was tricky It was very hard Probably What y'all say have any of you got the shot yet? Hello I definitely didn't know the first question. Hey all. Happy I finally got in on a game Hello Ts so ass Same where is everyone from? Im from Cali :) Happy to be here NC! California Mississippi Sc AL I'm from Georgia Delaware Ohio NV Hi everyone texas Louisiana Am also happy to be here VA South Africa How many questions? Washington DC South Africa Idk California Has any one played this game before No What's it like in South Africa? yes Naw No Hello everyone. No never played Reporting live from my village &#x1F923; No I have not played the game before 1st time playing Wow! South Africa.  Hello. what i heard the side effects are only sore arms and being sleepy South Africa is great. I'm sleeping next to my lion and zebra&#x1F602; I've already had COVID  and feel confident that me having had it i 30 I know u lying lol lion n zebra? Haven't gotten it, won't get it, and pretty sure I caught it twice already Really Ms. Helen? Damn you got it twice Are we supposed to be picking the correct answer or general consensus i think i had it once during the beginning Nor surw Bc Google said 1080 After this game I need to feed my lions &#x1F923; Smart Probably the correct answer I think having had COVID is more affective than the vaccine itself I'm going with 1080 I'm just joking Deb&#x1F602;&#x1F602; My answer was below the average I never thought about googling Yeah Reese&#x1F602;&#x1F602; Me too Me neither Girl Ms. Helen.  Lol My answer was below average Maybe .y answer wa out of 1000. I think they did ask about 10 million do you guys like using prolific? Same Mines was very low. Yes. Prolific is great. Except that it's over flooded w ppl and it's hard to get a survey now Profilic is neat, just started on it. Yes I like prolific except for the bugs sometimes which keeps you from getting paid. i enjoy it How long does it take to get a survey? I like Prolific a lot i like prolific too. Better paying than other sites. These days it's hard to get surveys&#x1F605; i get like seven surveys a day I usually average about 3 surveys. Except weekends. Dang u must have a good demographic Someone send me sites  i can hustle studies in my inbox:francisclinton02@gmail.com Still waiting for others to finish this short survey. do you guys update the ""about me "" questions so you can get more range of surveys ? It's slower during the times universities may be closed I used to catch a lot but since I started focusing on another site I don't get them as often. 1080 is the answer 1080? That's what Google says what other site u use Somniax what site please? i put 1080 I unsure too. I did too same I'm in the US sometimes I get emails at 2 a.m. 4 a.m. saying I have surveys. I put 1080 I did my own research, and I think the numbers could be in the billions, maybe even the trillions! It could be more. They probably saying people had underlying health conditions so they don't count i found out about prolific from tik tok lol what research? i did too lmaooo! Idk I pushed it to 2k just in case but I just googled it Tell us about prolific its easy af! just take surveys & get paid. It's called doing your own research! Bc they asked a out serious. I still think it was 1080 Don't know. John its just a website you take surveys on and you get paid Ok, thanks Ok, I'll stick with 1080 Right but they asked about cdc I believe",0.43

411,"Hope I can finish today out You will How are you all feeling about the vaccine ? Sure Same here! Not sure yet. Need to get second dose, been a month Same here I've already been vaccinated; so I think I'm confident in it not sure yet either Not too good either I got my first vaccine last week Not too good myself It may keep you out of the hospital but it won't keep you from getting COVID and passing it My sinus has my nose blocked for over a year, sinus shots don't for the vaccine. the alternative of getting covid-19 isn&#x2019;t good at all Work and Tylenol either Hi Feel the same way someone I know right now is extremely sick and they were vaccinated It could be something you're eating that you're intolerant to Hi 2 Hi Hello 29 i dont like that its being forced in a way That&#x2019;s awful for your sick friend Well I stop eating wheat, might have to lay og Pasta I'd just like to see how the vaccine affects people after a longer term study. @15 me neither Exactly user 27 I don't really trust the vaccine Anything you eat everyday?? I agree 27! The variant is not going anywhere i just got vaccinated but im worried 8000 6000 how can a vaccination be made that quick for COVID after one year but it&#x2019;s so many different illnesses that still have no cure Last time we put 1080. What about this time?? Its not hard to figure out one for a virus, versus finding a cure for something like aids Are you guys real? Yes lol yes I&#x2019;m real I'm a figment of your imagination yes I'm real I am a starfleet officer Yes we are Yes how many of these have yall done Hahaha Commander of USS enterprise Hmmmm This is my first time @32 1 other 1 Just this one Hmmm still not convinced, lol My first time also First time I am optimistic about this I'm Archers future grabddaughter 2nd for me My first time too 2nd one for me How long it last Can anyone convert 11.1 cases per million to per 10000? 759 Who always participate in different research studies? I think around 111 That's the answer according to cdc. But I can't get it from per million to per 10000 Y'all redoing answer 500 Most folks said 3500 @7 that's right I changed mibe I stuck with the same answer. 111 Optimistic &#x1F44D;&#x1F3FE; None of my answers stayed the same Do we win based off our answer matches everybody's or if it matches the actual answer I said 3000 Do we win based off of our answer matches everybody's or if it matches the actual answer Good question Not sure I changed to 4000 I have no idea Not sure what if we all say the same number do we all win? lol I don't think we win anything...just get entered to a raffle! Yes Thas what I was thinking Did anyone win that 500 This is my 2nd time playing. I won 5 bucks last time But I don't know that's because my answer was way off or if it's what everybody else picks and it was just spread up between all of us You won 5.00 But I don't know that's because my answer was way off or if it's what everybody else picked and it was described up between all of us I got $5 the last time for participating",0

412,"Hi Hiya Hi Hello hello Hey Hello! Hey guys Hello Yo I guess we crashed last session, huh Eyyyy Greetings and Salutations Hello again I think so. Yeah a lot of websites are having issues today I got kicked off Yea a lot of sites have issues Hello I thought the crash was on my end Hi I thought it was just them booting us off due to the chat haha Hey &#x1F44B; Hey admins Me too 9 I thought that too. I think the issue is globally It Is a l l I k n o w I s I B e t t e r G e t M y M o n e y Right Anyone know what is going on what is the cause? Hshahahahhahaha that&#x2019;s the one With the social media being down Yeah I haven't heard of that I don't know. Someone actually removed FB from its DNS server Ig and fb are &#x1F44E; I think so too Good Wait no wayyy I keep changing my numbers So is what's app so when you go to login the internet ""forgets"" where the domain is Oh! wow That's pretty funny that is a big issue me too   22 61 Traffic cannot be routed because someone removed IG and FB and WhatsApp from all DNS servers globally at 11 am this morning I change my numbers as well because I don't have a clue. This occurs after yesterday's incident Hey guys Hi What happened yesterday a FB employee blew the whistle Tomorrow she testifies before congress Awesome So it looks sus Wow. That's scary actually The very next day after an employee leaked thousands of documents about the shady stuff going on The next day all FB owned domains crash Google it Like seriously This particular error is a DNS error so it was not a accident. I saw a tweet where someone took a photo of their servers and it was scrubbed All of them Even the employee servers Wow, that's so awful hey This is more serious than I thought Serves them right That sucks Oh really! People annoying That ain't fair you know Now  what to do This is way serious The physical hardware needs to be flushed Basically it is interrupting traffic Social media is how some make money &#x1F926;&#x1F3FD;&#x200D;&#x2640;&#xFE0F; But like I guess because FB used dozens of DNS's each one has to be turned back on Then the data can flow from A to B Apparently they ran everything off a single infrastructure so probably someone did something Now I am not an expert but nobody else is having this issue like last time when the entire planet had that internet blackout due to the solar flare It might be a mistake though, just what I think right now Zuck pulling all he can to win Seems to be Facebook and Instagram and I heard it&#x2019;s Instagram because Facebook bought them It seems so except IG which does not share DNS server with FB is also down Also Messenger Could be a case where they shared the same host Oh ok But IG has it's own domain So that is just weird I dont use either Lol It seems so shared host Hello mates",0.54

I stayed with 1000 I changed to 500 as well My number is still low I tried I went more off of The mortality rate since the disease has hit i stayed at 500 ive never read or heard the averages i think its 2000 r u sure it's 500 500 or higher and the numbers are what they give us imagine all the ones not being reported ooh js only talks about anaphylaxis, people are having other reactions, so i think the number is lower i upped it to 600 Good luck i said 1000 I made it 1000 oops me too im sticking with 630 I don&#x2019;t know im staying at 600 is vaccine mandatory some people got placebos No it is not Yes not yet",0

And yes I have the vaccine and a booster Don't trust vaccine but heard it has side effects yeah got when FDA approved I got two vaccines and a booster No side effects No vaccine for me yet. I want to see if people start growing tails first. I've been vaxed since April I'm very low risk tough. I don't go out much. you guys real? Am also vaccinated I modified my answer to 4100 What side effects have you heard about? Yes I'm real My answer remains constant at 200 or 5% Some of the vaccines lose their effectiveness after awhile and you have to get another one. Despite being full vaccinated I actually have covid right now it's wild Poor 11!! I'm so sorry My answer is 50 because it 2 to 5 people per million one website said 11 per million Am not sure 50 is low It does say severe that&#x2019;s what I based on What do we do now? I just got asked the same questions 2 more times. I am thinking 500, who has legit info on the figure? According to the CDC there are 11.1 cases per million doses Am thinking of 100 to 200 Switched to under 4000 Very mild symptoms. Most like a cold instead of the really intense symptoms some people reported having i will go with a thousand five CDC: Early safety monitoring of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has detected 21 cases of anaphylaxis after reported administration of 1,893,360 first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (11.1 cases per million vaccine doses administered) as well as cases of less severe nonanaphylaxis allergic reactions, based on U.S. data for December 14&#x2013;23, 2020.

Not me No clue It is free Yes I feel like they have tracer in the vaccine I don't think there's a lot of severe reactions I hope the number is lower, haha. But maybe 200 something? I guessed 960 I don't think it's more than 500 i think it&#x2019;s low too Average answer was 40 so i repick 50 Eek. I think I&#x2019;m too low. I saw that it&#x2019;s about 1% its hard to answer.  It is low but it sort of depends on how they categorize reactions. Wow. 1%? Tracer is something they follow and have acces to u I was thinking &#x1F914; Why is it always the same question you already have a tracer....your phone.  They don't need to put anything in a vaccine to trace you.\ You could of been tracked before covid was ever a think Exactly, 28! thing* First time here. The same question was asked last time? Where is the game Yes they just give us chances to change Haha, good point 28. Ur right phone tracer we're in the game already I completely trust the vaccine personally I do somewhat I believe it&#x2019;s the better then other options I don&#x2019;t believe in natural immunity for something like this I'm mad I didn't get paid for the vaccine Jobs were offering stuff like that Raven winning the super bowl",0.27

483,"Hello hi how are you? Hey. Here in so cal Hi everyone Hi everyone. Yes Yes fully yep triple doses not yet XD Yep, got mine after looking into the science and stats of it Not eligible yet not yet, but planned No Yes booster Waiting for booster co-workers getting boosters and getting insanely sick :( Anyone catch Covid How did everyone feel after the 3rd booster? Doing booster next week I felt fine. No issues Vaccinated and boostered here too booster in 2 weeks Did not catch Covid but family members did before the vaccine It's not technically getting sick, just your body creating antibodies to fight off stuff, and much safer than the actual virus No covid and no vaccine for me Yes but as an agoraphobe not sure if it helped anyone from PNW? :D Was just at the Oregon coast From DC area i haven't got the vaccine yet nor covid Hi Hi Hi I got my 3rd dose/booster yesterday!! User 11 - did you try Sea Level bakery? Anyone in Va I didn&#x2019;t. Im from NOVA Your shop? User 11, missed out, need to come back :) Def will in Hampton Roads looking for booster (y) This is taking a long time Booster shot will be available once the 5-12 age group get vaccination I am concerned about getting a little sick from booster, but will definitely not stop me from taking Hello, i hope everyone is good Are we here for the chat or for the questions 2000 You can talk about your concerns here. I looked up a lot of science about it, so I can probably address some of them def chat :D I know someone who just got his his third booster and only had arm soreness. Said the third one was better than the first two. Suggest how you respond can be unpredictable Cannon beach!  I was in Oceanside I have family losing jobs over it, the mandate isn't doing us any favors My booster only caused arm soreness. I just got my 8 y/o her first dose and I feel much better about her returning to school after holidays. I work at a hospital in I had no problem whatsoever with whisper with either of the 1st 2 vaccines scenes. But getting them was organized by my boss and now I'm not sure how to get a booster My mom and I both got it because we both have health complications. Qbut we chose to get it, I dont think usa government should force anyone to get it. Texas and there&#x2019;s a third wave predicted after Christmas It shouldn't since the vaccine only gets your antibodies going. The actual virus is more unpredictable because it could affect areas of the brain. I can't wait for it to be approved for 6mo-4 years old so life can be somewhat normal again. I had the 3rd one yesterday and my upper arm is pretty swollen and sore and i have had a slight headache all day, but not sure the headache is from the booster. Hoping that means my immunities are building! I got all three of my kids the vaccine Yeah, and we don't yet know the long term effects of the virus, whereas we have unprecedented amounts of data about the vaccines. I wish everyone would get vaccinated so Covid can be mitigated my sons teacher has long haul Covid. Can&#x2019;t smell or taste after a year User 16, I had a terrible headache for a week after first dose, only sore arm on second so curious if booster will give me a headache again. Not that it would stop me of course. kids are fine. No reaction My daughter did great! Sore arm for two days, zero other side effects. She&#x2019;s 8. I don't have kids, but I would definitely have them get fully vaccinated if I did I bought them a comic book about Jonas Salk. My 12 yo got his first shot To explain User24, i didn't seem to have any reaction to the first 2. The lady who gave me the shot said it's a half dose and most reactions seem to be similar to the first. No one I know had any negative reaction apart from the 1 person who had had covid. He got really sick. Seeing the devastating effects in the hospital made the decision an absolute no brained for me personally. *brained Of you had taken the others no need to get others...unless necessar6 Necessary*",0.13
